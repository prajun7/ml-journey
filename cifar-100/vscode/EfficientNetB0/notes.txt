EfficientNetB0 is a lightweight, efficient model with strong performance due to 
its compound scaling of depth, width, and resolution. Using pre-trained weights, 
it can extract robust features for CIFAR-100, potentially boosting accuracy beyond 
the 57% of the custom CNN (likely to 70-80% with fine-tuning). 
Its architecture is well-suited for small images like CIFAR-100's 32x32 pixels.
